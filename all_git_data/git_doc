|`git merge branch_name`|Merge another branch into current branch|
|`git push`|Send local commits to remote repository|
|`git pull`|Update local branch with changes from remote|

## **Advanced Git Commands**

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`git cherry-pick <commit>`|Apply a specific commit from one branch to another|
|`git rebase <branch>`|Move your branch’s commits on top of another branch|
|**Merge vs Rebase**|Merge: Creates a merge commit, branched history Rebase: No merge commit, linear history|

---

## **Handling Merge Conflicts**

- Create two branches (e.g., `dev` & `dev2`).
    
- Edit same file in both branches.
    
- When merging, Git will show conflicts to resolve manually.
